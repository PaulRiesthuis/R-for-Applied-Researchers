# Real dataset {#sec-real-dataset}

In the previous chapter, we learned how to install, load, and use R packages. These tools will be essential as we begin working with actual datasets.

In this chapter, we take the next step: we will **work with a real dataset in R**, explore and inspect it, and perform some initial data cleaning and analysis. Working with real data is an important milestone because it allows you to apply the skills you’ve learned so far—creating variables, manipulating data structures, and using packages—in a practical research context.

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

-   Import data from various sources (e.g., CSV, Excel)

-   Inspect and explore the dataset to understand its structure

-   Perform basic data cleaning and preparation

-   Apply simple data analysis and summaries

This chapter lays the foundation for all subsequent analyses in the book. Once you are comfortable importing and working with real datasets, you will be ready to conduct more advanced analyses and visualizations in later chapters.
