# Why R?

Before we start learning how to program in R, it is useful to first ask: *Why learn R at all?* In my view, R opens up an enormous range of possibilities—not only for data analysis, but also for data visualization, simulation, reproducible research, open science, or writing an Introduction to R book. In this short introductory chapter, I will highlight a few of the reasons why I think learning R is worthwhile.

## Data analyses

There are many point-and-click programs for statistical analysis such as SPSS, Minitab, Jamovi, and JASP. These are useful tools, but R has several important advantages.

-   **R is free and open source**, meaning anyone can use it without licensing costs.

-   **R is incredibly powerful and flexible.** With just a few lines of code, you can run very simple analyses—or extremely advanced ones.

-   **R gives you full control.** Instead of relying on menus, you can precisely specify your analyses and make your workflow transparent and reproducible.

For example, here is an independent samples *t*-test with simulated data:

### Independent sample t-test

```{r, message=F,warning=F}
# Simulate data for 2 groups (Cohen's d of .5)
g1 <- rnorm(100,1,2)
g2 <- rnorm(100,2,2)

# Conduct t.test
t.test(g1,g2)
```

### Linear mixed model

With a single line of code, it is possible conduct a linear mixed model (multilevel, hierarchical modeling, etc.):

```{r, message=F,warning=F}
# load package 
library(lme4)
library(flexplot)
f = flexplot::plant_growth

# Get data
e <- glmer(Diameter ~ Location + (1|Method), data=f)
summary(e)

```

### Item Response Theory

R also supports more advanced statistical models such as Item Response Theory:

```{r, message=F,warning=F}
# Load package
library(mirt)

# Load data
data <- expand.table(LSAT7)
itemstats(data)

# Run IRT
(mod1 <- mirt(data, 1))

# Plot IRT
item_plot <- plot(mod1, type = 'trace')
item_plot
```

## Data visualization

R is also an outstanding tool for data visualization. With packages such as **ggplot2**, you can design clean, publication-ready figures and fully customize them. The range of available visualization packages is enormous, making it possible to create almost any kind of figure you can imagine.

```{r, message=F,warning=F}
# Load package
library(ggplot2
        )
# Simulate data
sample_df <- data.frame(
  group = factor(rep(letters[1:3], each = 10)),
  value = rnorm(30)
)

# Create df with means
group_means_df <- setNames(
  aggregate(value ~ group, sample_df, mean),
  c("group", "group_mean")
)

# Create plot
vis <- ggplot(data = sample_df, mapping = aes(x = group, y = value)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_point(
    mapping = aes(y = group_mean), data = group_means_df,
    colour = 'red', size = 3
  )+
  theme_classic()

vis
```

## Simulation

R also makes it easy to simulate data. This is extremely useful for teaching statistics, planning studies, and understanding how methods behave under different conditions. Even fairly complex simulations can often be written in only a few lines of code.

For example, using the **faux** package, we can simulate datasets with experimental designs:

```{r, message=F,warning=F}
library(faux)

df <- sim_design(
  within = list(time = c("time1", "time2")),
  between = list(group = c("Exp", "Control")),
  n = 200,
  mu = c(2,3,4,5),
  sd = c(2,2,2,2),
  rep = 10)

df
```

## Open science

One of the strongest reasons to learn R is that it supports open, transparent, and reproducible science. Using **R Markdown** or **Quarto**, you can combine text, code, results, and figures in a single document. This means others can see *exactly* how analyses were conducted—and can reproduce or adapt them easily. You can even write entire research papers, reports, or books with these tools.

## Fun (and Surprisingly Useful) Extras

Beyond statistics, R has a wide range of creative and practical tools. For example, you can:

-   Merge and automate documents

    ```{r, eval=FALSE, message=F,warning=F}
    library(pdftools)
    pdf_combine(c("file1.pdf", "file2.pdf"), output = "merged.pdf")
    ```

-   Create QR codes

    ```{r, eval=FALSE, message=F,warning=F}
    library(qrcode)
    code <- qr_code("QR CODE")
    ```

-   Build interactive dashboards and Shiny apps

-   Generate geographical maps

-   Scrape and analyze web data

-   …and much more.
