    "text": "In the previous chapter, we learned how to install, load, and use R packages. These tools will be essential as we begin working with actual datasets.\nIn this chapter, we take the next step: we will work with a real dataset in R, explore and inspect it, and perform some initial data cleaning and analysis. Working with real data is an important milestone because it allows you to apply the skills you’ve learned so far—creating variables, manipulating data structures, and using packages—in a practical research context.\nBy the end of this chapter, you will be able to:\n\nImport data from various sources (e.g., CSV, Excel)\nInspect and explore the dataset to understand its structure\nPerform basic data cleaning and preparation\nApply simple data analysis and summaries\n\nThis chapter lays the foundation for all subsequent analyses in the book. Once you are comfortable importing and working with real datasets, you will be ready to conduct more advanced analyses and visualizations in later chapters.",
