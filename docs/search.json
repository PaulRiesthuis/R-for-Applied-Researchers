    "text": "Preface\nThis book is designed to serve as an accessible and practical introduction to R, aimed primarily at researchers and students who are new to the language. It begins with the fundamentals, providing clear guidance on how to get started, and gradually introduces more applied examples that are particularly relevant to psychological research.\nWith the recent rise of large language models such as ChatGPT, many coding tasks have become easier and more efficient. Throughout this book, I offer practical recommendations on how researchers can responsibly and effectively use these tools to support coding, data analysis, and problem-solving, without sacrificing scientific rigor or understanding. This book is also made with help of large language models.\nA central focus of the book is to equip readers with the skills to conduct analyses that are frequently encountered in psychological research. Each chapter provides step-by-step examples, best practices, and insights into common challenges, so that readers can confidently apply R to their own research questions.\n\nI hope this book serves as a helpful guide for anyone looking to develop a solid foundation in R, while also embracing modern tools that enhance productivity and reproducibility in research.\nYou can cite this resource as:\nRiesthuis, P. (2025). Introduction to data analyses in R.\nPaul Riesthuis",

    "section": "",
    "text": "1.1 Data analyses\nBefore we start learning how to program in R, it is useful to first ask: Why learn R at all? In my view, R opens up an enormous range of possibilities—not only for data analysis, but also for data visualization, simulation, reproducible research, open science, or writing an Introduction to R book. In this short introductory chapter, I will highlight a few of the reasons why I think learning R is worthwhile.\nThere are many point-and-click programs for statistical analysis such as SPSS, Minitab, Jamovi, and JASP. These are useful tools, but R has several important advantages.\nFor example, here is an independent samples t-test with simulated data:",

    "section": "1.2 Coding",
    "text": "1.2 Coding\nSo, in the source section we can actually code variables. The possibilities here are endless. That is, we can code a single number to be assigned to a variable name “y” but also conduct entire structural equation models, multilevel models, etc. Let’s start with some basics and most essential.\n\n1.2.1 Example 1: Variable with single number\n\nIn R we use “&lt;-” instead of “=” to assign variables.\nYou can copy code always by clicking the icon in the upper right of the code chunk.\n\n\nx &lt;- 7 \nx\n\n[1] 7\n\n\nTip: You can run code by selecting a line and pressing Ctrl + Enter (Windows) or Cmd + Enter (Mac).\n\n\n1.2.2 Example 2: Variable with multiple numbers\nThis is also known as a single row vector\n\nrow_vec &lt;- c(1,2,3,4,5)\nrow_vec\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\n\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Example 3: row vs column vectors\nIn R, the vectors we create are row vectors by default. Sometimes, it’s useful to create a column vector (a vector arranged vertically), especially when working with matrices or data frames.\n\ncol_vec &lt;- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), ncol = 1)\ncol_vec\n\n     [,1]\n[1,]    1\n[2,]    2\n[3,]    3\n[4,]    4\n[5,]    5\n\n\nExplanation:\n\nRow vector: A simple vector created with c(); elements are arranged horizontally when printed.\nColumn vector: Created using matrix() with ncol = 1; elements are arranged vertically.\nVectors are the building blocks for matrices and data frames in R.\nTip: In psychological research, a column often represents a variable (e.g., Age, Score) and a row represents a participant.\n\n\n\n1.2.4 Example 4: Dataframes\nA data frame is like a table in R. It can store columns of different types (numeric, character, logical) and is one of the most common ways to organize data for analysis.\n\ndf &lt;- data.frame(\nName = c(\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\"),\nAge = c(25, 30, 22),\nPassed = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)\n)\n\ndf\n\n     Name Age Passed\n1   Alice  25   TRUE\n2     Bob  30  FALSE\n3 Charlie  22   TRUE\n\n\nExplanation:\n\ndata.frame() creates a table-like structures\nColumns can have different types (numbers, text, logical values).\n\n\n\n1.2.5 Example 5: Accessing and Subsetting Data\n\nYou can access columns of a dataframe with $, e.g., df$Age.\n\n\ndf$Age\n\n[1] 25 30 22\n\ndf$Passed\n\n[1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE\n\n\nEach column is treated as a vector, so you can perform operations on it just like a normal vector.\n\nYou can access rows using row indices, e.g., df[1, ].\n\n\ndf[1, ]\n\n   Name Age Passed\n1 Alice  25   TRUE\n\ndf[2, ]\n\n  Name Age Passed\n2  Bob  30  FALSE\n\n\nThe syntax is df[row, column]. Leaving the column blank selects all columns (or vice versa).\n\nYou can filter rows using logical conditions. For example, to select all participants who passed:\n\n\ndf[df$Passed == TRUE, ]\n\n     Name Age Passed\n1   Alice  25   TRUE\n3 Charlie  22   TRUE\n\n\nSome useful logical operators in R:\n\n== → equal to\n!= → not equal to\n&gt; → greater than\n&lt; → less than\n&gt;= → greater than or equal to\n&lt;= → less than or equal to\n& → AND\n| → OR\n\nExample: Select participants who passed or are older than 25:\n\ndf[df$Passed == TRUE & df$Age &gt; 24, ]\n\n   Name Age Passed\n1 Alice  25   TRUE\n\n\nThere are also packages in R that others have created that also perform these data manipulations but also more advanced such as “dplyr”.\n\nFor example, we can select Age or Passed columns:\n\n\n# install.packages(dplyr) # Run the code before without \"#\" to install the package\nlibrary(dplyr) # This is to call the packages\n\nWarning: package 'dplyr' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\ndf %&gt;% select(Age)\n\n  Age\n1  25\n2  30\n3  22\n\ndf %&gt;% select(Passed)\n\n  Passed\n1   TRUE\n2  FALSE\n3   TRUE\n\n\n\nOr we can filter only participants who passed the test:\n\ndf %&gt;% filter(Passed == TRUE)\n\n     Name Age Passed\n1   Alice  25   TRUE\n2 Charlie  22   TRUE\n\n\nOr select and filter simultaneously for which we need “%&gt;%” (pipe) operator:\n\ndf %&gt;%\nfilter(Passed == TRUE) %&gt;%\nselect(Name, Age)\n\n     Name Age\n1   Alice  25\n2 Charlie  22\n\n\n\nWhy dplyr is useful:\n\nSyntax is more readable than base R, especially for beginners.\nYou can chain multiple operations with %&gt;%, which makes your code look like a step-by-step pipeline.\nWorks well for larger datasets and more complex filtering.\n\nThere are many powerful functions in dplyr, and we’ll explore them gradually throughout the book. However, tools like large language models can be extremely helpful when you want to automate your workflow. You can simply describe—in plain language—what you want to do (e.g., “filter rows where Age is above 30 and select only the Name column”), and the model can generate the corresponding R code for you.\n\n\n1.2.6 Example 6: Descriptive statistics\nIt is also quite easy to compute mean, median, standard deviation or other statistics:\n\nmean(df$Age)\n\n[1] 25.66667\n\nmedian(df$Age)\n\n[1] 25\n\nsd(df$Age)\n\n[1] 4.041452\n\nsummary(df)\n\n     Name                Age          Passed       \n Length:3           Min.   :22.00   Mode :logical  \n Class :character   1st Qu.:23.50   FALSE:1        \n Mode  :character   Median :25.00   TRUE :2        \n                    Mean   :25.67                  \n                    3rd Qu.:27.50                  \n                    Max.   :30.00                  \n\n\nThere are also packages that will automatically summarise your data and provide additional information such as “psych”.\n\n# install.packages(psych) # Run the code before without \"#\" to install the package\n\nlibrary(psych)\ndescribe(df)\n\nWarning in FUN(newX[, i], ...): no non-missing arguments to min; returning Inf\n\n\nWarning in FUN(newX[, i], ...): no non-missing arguments to max; returning -Inf\n\n\n       vars n  mean   sd median trimmed  mad min  max range skew kurtosis   se\nName*     1 3  2.00 1.00      2    2.00 1.48   1    3     2 0.00    -2.33 0.58\nAge       2 3 25.67 4.04     25   25.67 4.45  22   30     8 0.16    -2.33 2.33\nPassed    3 3   NaN   NA     NA     NaN   NA Inf -Inf  -Inf   NA       NA   NA\n\n\n\n\n1.2.7 Summary and conclusion\nIn this introductory chapter, we explored the basic structure and functionality of R and RStudio. You learned how the main interface is organized, how to write and run simple pieces of code, and how to create and manipulate some of the most fundamental data structures in R, such as vectors and data frames. We also introduced essential tools for inspecting and filtering data, both using base R and the more readable dplyr syntax. These skills form the foundation of nearly all data analysis work in R. In the next chapter, we will build on this foundation by working with a real dataset—importing it, exploring it, and preparing it for analysis—so you can see how these tools apply to actual research scenarios.",

Visualization is an essential step in data analysis because it allows us to understand patterns, spot outliers, and communicate results clearly.\n\n3.7.1 Belief and recollection overall\nFirst, we will visualize the overall belief and recollection scores. These scores combine responses from six memory questions. We use ggplot2 for flexible plotting:\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ThemePark)\n# Plot\nplot_belief &lt;- ggplot(df_analysis, aes(x = condition, y = overall_belief, fill = condition)) +\n  geom_jitter(\n    width = 0.15,\n    alpha = 0.5,\n    size = 2,\n    shape = 21,\n    color = \"black\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    limits = c(1, 7),\n    breaks = 1:7\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    y = \"Belief and Recollection Score\",\n    x = NULL\n  ) +\n  theme_barbie() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 16),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 18),\n    panel.grid = element_blank()\n  )\n\nplot_belief\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_jitter spreads points horizontally so overlapping points are visible\nThe plot shows individual participant scores as well as the overall pattern by condition\ntheme_babie is from ThemePark where many other cool themes are available\n\nYou can also use ggstatsplot for plots with built-in statistical summaries:\n\nlibrary(ggstatsplot)\n\nggbetweenstats(\n  data  = df_analysis,\n  x     = condition,\n  y     = overall_belief,\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.7.2 Belief and recollection individual\nSometimes, it’s useful to examine each question separately instead of combining them into a single overall score. To do this, we need to reshape the dataset from wide to long format.\nIn wide format, each participant has a single row, with responses to different questions stored in separate columns (e.g., x1 to x6). In long format, each row represents one participant’s response to a single question. As a result, each participant contributes multiple rows — one for each question.\nReshaping data in this way is typical when working with multilevel models (also called hierarchical linear models or linear mixed models), where each observation (row) represents a participant-item combination. Long-format datasets also make it easier to generate faceted plots, apply grouped summaries, or run analyses that consider responses at the item level.\nR provides convenient functions for switching between formats: pivot_longer() converts wide data to long, and pivot_wider() converts long data back to wide. Mastering these functions allows you to easily manipulate your dataset depending on the type of analysis or visualization you want to perform.\nIn our dataset, reshaping to long format will result in six rows per participant — one for each question. Once in this format, we can create plots that show responses to each question across conditions, which provides a more detailed view of the data compared with the overall score.\n\nlibrary(tidyr)\ndf_long &lt;- df_analysis %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = starts_with(\"x\"),\n    names_to = \"question\",\n    values_to = \"score\"\n  )\n\nhead(df_long,12)\n\n# A tibble: 12 × 7\n   participants condition      subcondition_2 total_memory_errors overall_belief\n          &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt;                        &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1            1 Unlikely Chea… Honest                          11           1.17\n 2            1 Unlikely Chea… Honest                          11           1.17\n 3            1 Unlikely Chea… Honest                          11           1.17\n 4            1 Unlikely Chea… Honest                          11           1.17\n 5            1 Unlikely Chea… Honest                          11           1.17\n 6            1 Unlikely Chea… Honest                          11           1.17\n 7            2 Unlikely Chea… Lie                             22           1.33\n 8            2 Unlikely Chea… Lie                             22           1.33\n 9            2 Unlikely Chea… Lie                             22           1.33\n10            2 Unlikely Chea… Lie                             22           1.33\n11            2 Unlikely Chea… Lie                             22           1.33\n12            2 Unlikely Chea… Lie                             22           1.33\n# ℹ 2 more variables: question &lt;chr&gt;, score &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\nNow, each participant has six rows — one per question — making it easy to create faceted plots:\n\nggplot(df_long, aes(x = condition, y = score, fill = condition)) +\n  geom_jitter(width = 0.15, alpha = 0.5, size = 2, shape = 21, color = \"black\") +\n  facet_wrap(~question, \n             scales = \"free_y\") +\n  labs(y = \"Score\", \n       x = NULL) +\n  theme_barbie(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\", \n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, \n                                   hjust = 1))\n\nWarning in plot_theme(plot): The `base_size` theme element is not defined in\nthe element hierarchy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach panel corresponds to one question\nscales = \"free_y\" allows each question’s responses to use its own y-axis, making patterns easier to see\n\n\n\n3.7.3 Memory errors\nFor completeness, we can visualize the total memory errors:\n\nggbetweenstats(\n  data  = df_analysis,\n  x     = condition,\n  y     = total_memory_errors,\n)",

    "section": "2.2 Coding",
    "text": "2.2 Coding\nSo, in the source section we can actually code variables. The possibilities here are endless. That is, we can code a single number to be assigned to a variable name “y” but also conduct entire structural equation models, multilevel models, etc. Let’s start with some basics and most essential.\n\n2.2.1 Example 1: Variable with single number\n\nIn R we use “&lt;-” instead of “=” to assign variables.\nYou can copy code always by clicking the icon in the upper right of the code chunk.\n\n\nx &lt;- 7 \nx\n\n[1] 7\n\n\nTip: You can run code by selecting a line and pressing Ctrl + Enter (Windows) or Cmd + Enter (Mac).\n\n\n2.2.2 Example 2: Variable with multiple numbers\nThis is also known as a single row vector\n\nrow_vec &lt;- c(1,2,3,4,5)\nrow_vec\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Example 3: row vs column vectors\nIn R, the vectors we create are row vectors by default. Sometimes, it’s useful to create a column vector (a vector arranged vertically), especially when working with matrices or data frames.\n\ncol_vec &lt;- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), ncol = 1)\ncol_vec\n\n     [,1]\n[1,]    1\n[2,]    2\n[3,]    3\n[4,]    4\n[5,]    5\n\n\nExplanation:\n\nRow vector: A simple vector created with c(); elements are arranged horizontally when printed.\nColumn vector: Created using matrix() with ncol = 1; elements are arranged vertically.\nVectors are the building blocks for matrices and data frames in R.\nTip: In psychological research, a column often represents a variable (e.g., Age, Score) and a row represents a participant.\n\n\n\n2.2.4 Example 4: Dataframes\nA data frame is like a table in R. It can store columns of different types (numeric, character, logical) and is one of the most common ways to organize data for analysis.\n\ndf &lt;- data.frame(\nName = c(\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\"),\nAge = c(25, 30, 22),\nPassed = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)\n)\n\ndf\n\n     Name Age Passed\n1   Alice  25   TRUE\n2     Bob  30  FALSE\n3 Charlie  22   TRUE\n\n\nExplanation:\n\ndata.frame() creates a table-like structures\nColumns can have different types (numbers, text, logical values).\n\n\n\n2.2.5 Example 5: Accessing and Subsetting Data\n\nYou can access columns of a dataframe with $, e.g., df$Age.\n\n\ndf$Age\n\n[1] 25 30 22\n\ndf$Passed\n\n[1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE\n\n\nEach column is treated as a vector, so you can perform operations on it just like a normal vector.\n\nYou can access rows using row indices, e.g., df[1, ].\n\n\ndf[1, ]\n\n   Name Age Passed\n1 Alice  25   TRUE\n\ndf[2, ]\n\n  Name Age Passed\n2  Bob  30  FALSE\n\n\nThe syntax is df[row, column]. Leaving the column blank selects all columns (or vice versa).\n\nYou can filter rows using logical conditions. For example, to select all participants who passed:\n\n\ndf[df$Passed == TRUE, ]\n\n     Name Age Passed\n1   Alice  25   TRUE\n3 Charlie  22   TRUE\n\n\nSome useful logical operators in R:\n\n== → equal to\n!= → not equal to\n&gt; → greater than\n&lt; → less than\n&gt;= → greater than or equal to\n&lt;= → less than or equal to\n& → AND\n| → OR\n\nExample: Select participants who passed or are older than 25:\n\ndf[df$Passed == TRUE & df$Age &gt; 24, ]\n\n   Name Age Passed\n1 Alice  25   TRUE\n\n\nThere are also packages in R that others have created that also perform these data manipulations but also more advanced such as “dplyr”.\n\nFor example, we can select Age or Passed columns:\n\n\n# install.packages(dplyr) # Run the code before without \"#\" to install the package\nlibrary(dplyr) # This is to call the packages\n\nWarning: package 'dplyr' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\ndf %&gt;% select(Age)\n\n  Age\n1  25\n2  30\n3  22\n\ndf %&gt;% select(Passed)\n\n  Passed\n1   TRUE\n2  FALSE\n3   TRUE\n\n\n\nOr we can filter only participants who passed the test:\n\ndf %&gt;% filter(Passed == TRUE)\n\n     Name Age Passed\n1   Alice  25   TRUE\n2 Charlie  22   TRUE\n\n\nOr select and filter simultaneously for which we need “%&gt;%” (pipe) operator:\n\ndf %&gt;%\nfilter(Passed == TRUE) %&gt;%\nselect(Name, Age)\n\n     Name Age\n1   Alice  25\n2 Charlie  22\n\n\n\nWhy dplyr is useful:\n\nSyntax is more readable than base R, especially for beginners.\nYou can chain multiple operations with %&gt;%, which makes your code look like a step-by-step pipeline.\nWorks well for larger datasets and more complex filtering.\n\nThere are many powerful functions in dplyr, and we’ll explore them gradually throughout the book. However, tools like large language models can be extremely helpful when you want to automate your workflow. You can simply describe—in plain language—what you want to do (e.g., “filter rows where Age is above 30 and select only the Name column”), and the model can generate the corresponding R code for you.\n\n\n2.2.6 Example 6: Descriptive statistics\nIt is also quite easy to compute mean, median, standard deviation or other statistics:\n\nmean(df$Age)\n\n[1] 25.66667\n\nmedian(df$Age)\n\n[1] 25\n\nsd(df$Age)\n\n[1] 4.041452\n\nsummary(df)\n\n     Name                Age          Passed       \n Length:3           Min.   :22.00   Mode :logical  \n Class :character   1st Qu.:23.50   FALSE:1        \n Mode  :character   Median :25.00   TRUE :2        \n                    Mean   :25.67                  \n                    3rd Qu.:27.50                  \n                    Max.   :30.00                  \n\n\nThere are also packages that will automatically summarise your data and provide additional information such as “psych”.\n\n# install.packages(psych) # Run the code before without \"#\" to install the package\n\nlibrary(psych)\ndescribe(df)\n\nWarning in FUN(newX[, i], ...): no non-missing arguments to min; returning Inf\n\n\nWarning in FUN(newX[, i], ...): no non-missing arguments to max; returning -Inf\n\n\n       vars n  mean   sd median trimmed  mad min  max range skew kurtosis   se\nName*     1 3  2.00 1.00      2    2.00 1.48   1    3     2 0.00    -2.33 0.58\nAge       2 3 25.67 4.04     25   25.67 4.45  22   30     8 0.16    -2.33 2.33\nPassed    3 3   NaN   NA     NA     NaN   NA Inf -Inf  -Inf   NA       NA   NA\n\n\n\n\n2.2.7 Summary and conclusion\nIn this introductory chapter, we explored the basic structure and functionality of R and RStudio. You learned how the main interface is organized, how to write and run simple pieces of code, and how to create and manipulate some of the most fundamental data structures in R, such as vectors and data frames. We also introduced essential tools for inspecting and filtering data, both using base R and the more readable dplyr syntax. These skills form the foundation of nearly all data analysis work in R. In the next chapter, we will build on this foundation by working with a real dataset—importing it, exploring it, and preparing it for analysis—so you can see how these tools apply to actual research scenarios.",

These tools are essential for real-world data analysis, and now we will start applying them in practice.\nIn this chapter, we take the next step: working with a real dataset in R (download dataset here) We will learn how to import data, inspect its structure, clean and prepare it, and perform the first simple analyses. Working with real data is an important milestone because it brings together all the skills you’ve learned so far—creating variables, manipulating data, and using packages—in a practical research context.\nBy the end of this chapter, you will be able to:\nThese skills form the foundation for all subsequent chapters. Once you are comfortable importing and working with real datasets, you will be ready to move on to more advanced analyses and data visualizations.\nTo start working with a real dataset, I will use my own data of my own study Registered Report: The effects of incentivized lies on memory. In this study, participants (n = 230) were randomly assigned to one of two conditions:\nParticipants completed an adapted Sequential Dyadic Die-Rolling paradigm, where they rolled a die and reported its outcome. Depending on the condition:\nTwo days later, participants completed two forms of memory assessment:\nWe will use this dataset to demonstrate the workflow for importing, viewing, and preparing data for analysis.",

To do this, we need to reshape the dataset from wide to long format.\nIn wide format, each participant has a single row, with responses to different questions stored in separate columns (e.g., x1 to x6). In long format, each row represents one participant’s response to a single question. As a result, each participant contributes multiple rows — one for each question.\nReshaping data in this way is typical when working with multilevel models (also called hierarchical linear models or linear mixed models), where each observation (row) represents a participant-item combination. Long-format datasets also make it easier to generate faceted plots, apply grouped summaries, or run analyses that consider responses at the item level.\nR provides convenient functions for switching between formats: pivot_longer() converts wide data to long, and pivot_wider() converts long data back to wide. Mastering these functions allows you to easily manipulate your dataset depending on the type of analysis or visualization you want to perform.\nIn our dataset, reshaping to long format will result in six rows per participant — one for each question. Once in this format, we can create plots that show responses to each question across conditions, which provides a more detailed view of the data compared with the overall score.\n\nlibrary(tidyr)\ndf_long &lt;- df_analysis %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = starts_with(\"x\"),\n    names_to = \"question\",\n    values_to = \"score\"\n  )\n\nhead(df_long,12)\n\n# A tibble: 12 × 7\n   participants condition      subcondition_2 total_memory_errors overall_belief\n          &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt;                        &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1            1 Unlikely Chea… Honest                          11           1.17\n 2            1 Unlikely Chea… Honest                          11           1.17\n 3            1 Unlikely Chea… Honest                          11           1.17\n 4            1 Unlikely Chea… Honest                          11           1.17\n 5            1 Unlikely Chea… Honest                          11           1.17\n 6            1 Unlikely Chea… Honest                          11           1.17\n 7            2 Unlikely Chea… Lie                             22           1.33\n 8            2 Unlikely Chea… Lie                             22           1.33\n 9            2 Unlikely Chea… Lie                             22           1.33\n10            2 Unlikely Chea… Lie                             22           1.33\n11            2 Unlikely Chea… Lie                             22           1.33\n12            2 Unlikely Chea… Lie                             22           1.33\n# ℹ 2 more variables: question &lt;chr&gt;, score &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\nNow, each participant has six rows — one per question — making it easy to create faceted plots:\n\nggplot(df_long, aes(x = condition, y = score, fill = condition)) +\n  geom_jitter(width = 0.15, alpha = 0.5, size = 2, shape = 21, color = \"black\") +\n  facet_wrap(~question, \n             scales = \"free_y\") +\n  labs(y = \"Score\", \n       x = NULL) +\n  theme_barbie(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\", \n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, \n                                   hjust = 1))\n\nWarning in plot_theme(plot): The `base_size` theme element is not defined in\nthe element hierarchy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach panel corresponds to one question\nscales = \"free_y\" allows each question’s responses to use its own y-axis, making patterns easier to see\n\n\n\n4.7.3 Memory errors\nFor completeness, we can visualize the total memory errors:\n\nggbetweenstats(\n  data  = df_analysis,\n  x     = condition,\n  y     = total_memory_errors,\n)",

However, many real-world datasets contain nested or clustered data structures. This becomes especially relevant when we want to address questions about individual differences as we discussed in a previous meting. In this chapter, we take the next step: working with multilevel data in R.\nIn our example, legal professionals evaluated multiple scenarios. This means that each participant contributed multiple responses. The data are therefore not independent — responses are nested within individuals.\nBy the end of this chapter, you will be able to:\nThese skills are essential when working with repeated measures, longitudinal designs, educational data, or any structure where observations are grouped within higher-level units.\nIn this example, we use data from a study among legal professionals in Belgium and the Netherlands. Participants evaluated three different scenarios, each consisting of six items measuring memory errors. Download the dataset here (download dataset here\nBecause each participant responded to multiple items across multiple scenarios, the dataset has a two-level structure:\nThis nested structure requires multilevel modeling.",
