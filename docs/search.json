    "text": "Preface\nThis book is designed to serve as an accessible and practical introduction to R, aimed primarily at researchers and students who are new to the language. It begins with the fundamentals, providing clear guidance on how to get started, and gradually introduces more applied examples that are particularly relevant to psychological research.\nWith the recent rise of large language models such as ChatGPT, many coding tasks have become easier and more efficient. Throughout this book, I offer practical recommendations on how researchers can responsibly and effectively use these tools to support coding, data analysis, and problem-solving, without sacrificing scientific rigor or understanding. This book is also made with help of large language models.\nA central focus of the book is to equip readers with the skills to conduct analyses that are frequently encountered in psychological research. Each chapter provides step-by-step examples, best practices, and insights into common challenges, so that readers can confidently apply R to their own research questions.\n\nI hope this book serves as a helpful guide for anyone looking to develop a solid foundation in R, while also embracing modern tools that enhance productivity and reproducibility in research.\nYou can cite this resource as:\nRiesthuis, P.

    "text": "1.1 R and Rstudio\nWhen I first started working with R, I remember being confused by the fact that many people recommended downloading both R and RStudio. I didn’t fully understand why RStudio was necessary.\nThe simplest way to think about it is that RStudio is a convenient interface (an IDE) that makes it easier to write, run, and manage your R code. You use R as the underlying language, and RStudio as the environment that helps you work with that language more effectively.\nThe Rstudio looks as follows:\nThe RStudio interface is divided into four main sections that help you write, run, and manage your R code efficiently:\nSummarized:\nA simple way to remember the sections:",

    "section": "1.2 Coding",
    "text": "1.2 Coding\nSo, in the source section we can actually code variables. The possibilities here are endless. That is, we can code a single number to be assigned to a variable name “y” but also conduct entire structural equation models, multilevel models, etc. Let’s start with some basics and most essential.\n\n1.2.1 Example 1: Variable with single number\n\nIn R we use “&lt;-” instead of “=” to assign variables.\nYou can copy code always by clicking the icon in the upper right of the code chunk.\n\n\nx &lt;- 7 \nx\n\n[1] 7\n\n\nTip: You can run code by selecting a line and pressing Ctrl + Enter (Windows) or Cmd + Enter (Mac).\n\n\n1.2.2 Example 2: Variable with multiple numbers\nThis is also known as a single row vector\n\nrow_vec &lt;- c(1,2,3,4,5)\nrow_vec\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\n\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Example 3: row vs column vectors\nIn R, the vectors we create are row vectors by default. Sometimes, it’s useful to create a column vector (a vector arranged vertically), especially when working with matrices or data frames.\n\ncol_vec &lt;- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), ncol = 1)\ncol_vec\n\n     [,1]\n[1,]    1\n[2,]    2\n[3,]    3\n[4,]    4\n[5,]    5\n\n\nExplanation:\n\nRow vector: A simple vector created with c(); elements are arranged horizontally when printed.\nColumn vector: Created using matrix() with ncol = 1; elements are arranged vertically.\nVectors are the building blocks for matrices and data frames in R.\nTip: In psychological research, a column often represents a variable (e.g., Age, Score) and a row represents a participant.\n\n\n\n1.2.4 Example 4: Dataframes\nA data frame is like a table in R. It can store columns of different types (numeric, character, logical) and is one of the most common ways to organize data for analysis.\n\ndf &lt;- data.frame(\nName = c(\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\"),\nAge = c(25, 30, 22),\nPassed = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)\n)\n\ndf\n\n     Name Age Passed\n1   Alice  25   TRUE\n2     Bob  30  FALSE\n3 Charlie  22   TRUE\n\n\nExplanation:\n\ndata.frame() creates a table-like structures\nColumns can have different types (numbers, text, logical values).\n\n\n\n1.2.5 Example 5: Accessing and Subsetting Data\n\nYou can access columns of a dataframe with $, e.g., df$Age.\n\n\ndf$Age\n\n[1] 25 30 22\n\ndf$Passed\n\n[1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE\n\n\nEach column is treated as a vector, so you can perform operations on it just like a normal vector.\n\nYou can access rows using row indices, e.g., df[1, ].\n\n\ndf[1, ]\n\n   Name Age Passed\n1 Alice  25   TRUE\n\ndf[2, ]\n\n  Name Age Passed\n2  Bob  30  FALSE\n\n\nThe syntax is df[row, column]. Leaving the column blank selects all columns (or vice versa).\n\nYou can filter rows using logical conditions. For example, to select all participants who passed:\n\n\ndf[df$Passed == TRUE, ]\n\n     Name Age Passed\n1   Alice  25   TRUE\n3 Charlie  22   TRUE\n\n\nSome useful logical operators in R:\n\n== → equal to\n!= → not equal to\n&gt; → greater than\n&lt; → less than\n&gt;= → greater than or equal to\n&lt;= → less than or equal to\n& → AND\n| → OR\n\nExample: Select participants who passed or are older than 25:\n\ndf[df$Passed == TRUE & df$Age &gt; 24, ]\n\n   Name Age Passed\n1 Alice  25   TRUE\n\n\nThere are also packages in R that others have created that also perform these data manipulations but also more advanced such as “dplyr”.\n\nFor example, we can select Age or Passed columns:\n\n\n# install.packages(dplyr) # Run the code before without \"#\" to install the package\nlibrary(dplyr) # This is to call the packages\n\ndf %&gt;% select(Age)\n\n  Age\n1  25\n2  30\n3  22\n\ndf %&gt;% select(Passed)\n\n  Passed\n1   TRUE\n2  FALSE\n3   TRUE\n\n\n\nOr we can filter only participants who passed the test:\n\ndf %&gt;% filter(Passed == TRUE)\n\n     Name Age Passed\n1   Alice  25   TRUE\n2 Charlie  22   TRUE\n\n\nOr select and filter simultaneously for which we need “%&gt;%” (pipe) operator:\n\ndf %&gt;%\nfilter(Passed == TRUE) %&gt;%\nselect(Name, Age)\n\n     Name Age\n1   Alice  25\n2 Charlie  22\n\n\n\nWhy dplyr is useful:\n\nSyntax is more readable than base R, especially for beginners.\nYou can chain multiple operations with %&gt;%, which makes your code look like a step-by-step pipeline.\nWorks well for larger datasets and more complex filtering.\n\nThere are many powerful functions in dplyr, and we’ll explore them gradually throughout the book. However, tools like large language models can be extremely helpful when you want to automate your workflow. You can simply describe—in plain language—what you want to do (e.g., “filter rows where Age is above 30 and select only the Name column”), and the model can generate the corresponding R code for you.\n\n\n1.2.6 Example 6: Descriptive statistics\nIt is also quite easy to compute mean, median, standard deviation or other statistics:\n\nmean(df$Age)\n\n[1] 25.66667\n\nmedian(df$Age)\n\n[1] 25\n\nsd(df$Age)\n\n[1] 4.041452\n\nsummary(df)\n\n     Name                Age          Passed       \n Length:3           Min.   :22.00   Mode :logical  \n Class :character   1st Qu.:23.50   FALSE:1        \n Mode  :character   Median :25.00   TRUE :2        \n                    Mean   :25.67                  \n                    3rd Qu.:27.50                  \n                    Max.   :30.00                  \n\n\nThere are also packages that will automatically summarise your data and provide additional information such as “psych”.\n\n# install.packages(psych) # Run the code before without \"#\" to install the package\n\nlibrary(psych)\ndescribe(df)\n\nWarning in FUN(newX[, i], ...): no non-missing arguments to min; returning Inf\n\n\nWarning in FUN(newX[, i], ...): no non-missing arguments to max; returning -Inf\n\n\n       vars n  mean   sd median trimmed  mad min  max range skew kurtosis   se\nName*     1 3  2.00 1.00      2    2.00 1.48   1    3     2 0.00    -2.33 0.58\nAge       2 3 25.67 4.04     25   25.67 4.45  22   30     8 0.16    -2.33 2.33\nPassed    3 3   NaN   NA     NA     NaN   NA Inf -Inf  -Inf   NA       NA   NA\n\n\n\n\n1.2.7 Summary and conclusion\nIn this introductory chapter, we explored the basic structure and functionality of R and RStudio. You learned how the main interface is organized, how to write and run simple pieces of code, and how to create and manipulate some of the most fundamental data structures in R, such as vectors and data frames. We also introduced essential tools for inspecting and filtering data, both using base R and the more readable dplyr syntax. These skills form the foundation of nearly all data analysis work in R. In the next chapter, we will build on this foundation by working with a real dataset—importing it, exploring it, and preparing it for analysis—so you can see how these tools apply to actual research scenarios.",
