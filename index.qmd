# Preface {.unnumbered}

This book is designed to serve as an accessible and practical introduction to **R**, aimed primarily at researchers and students who are new to the language. It begins with the fundamentals, providing clear guidance on how to get started, and gradually introduces more applied examples that are particularly relevant to psychological research.

With the recent rise of **large language models** such as ChatGPT, many coding tasks have become easier and more efficient. Throughout this book, I offer practical recommendations on how researchers can responsibly and effectively use these tools to support coding, data analysis, and problem-solving, without sacrificing scientific rigor or understanding. This book is also made with help of large language models.

A central focus of the book is to equip readers with the skills to conduct analyses that are frequently encountered in psychological research. Each chapter provides step-by-step examples, best practices, and insights into common challenges, so that readers can confidently apply R to their own research questions.

I hope this book serves as a helpful guide for anyone looking to develop a solid foundation in R, while also embracing modern tools that enhance productivity and reproducibility in research.
